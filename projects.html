        <h2>Leveraging Platform-Specific Guidelines for Improved Hate Speech Detection</h2>
        <h4>Authors: Bhavya Dwivedi, Emerald High School, Grade 10; Diana Galvan-Sosa, ALTA Institute, Computer Laboratory University of Cambridge</h4>
        <h4>June 2024 - February 2025</h4>
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <br>
            Many people use online platforms such as Instagram and Facebook on a daily basis. These applications often feature comment sections where users can express their opinions. 
            Unfortunately, it is common for this feature to be used inappropriately, with people posting offensive comments towards individuals or groups. 
            Defining what represents offensive content is difficult, as it varies by context, making AI removal challenging. 
            In order to offer additional awareness on hateful and abusive conduct in social media, this work focuses on the SemEval-2023 task of binary sexism detection. 
            Our data analysis indicates that adding a new label would be beneficial for enhancing the dataset's alignment with real-world applications. 
            Towards this end, this work presents a simple baseline model using cosine similarity to assess comment alignment with different platform guidelines to highlight 
            how these comments differ from the community guidelines.

        <h2>A Coupled HPA–Mirror Neuron Model of Chronic Maternal
            Stress and Autism Susceptibility </h2>
        <h4>Authors: Bhavya Dwivedi, Emerald High School, Grade 10</h4>
        <h4>February 2025 - Present</h4>
        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <br>
        Stress experienced by a mother during pregnancy can profoundly influence the neurode-
        velopment of the fetus, potentially increasing susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders.
        We investigate these effects by extending a minimal mathematical model of the hypothala-
        mic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis to include mirror neuron activity in the premotor cortex.
        Our coupled system of differential equations captures the short-term (acute) versus long-
        term (chronic) impacts of maternal stress on embryonic development. We show that acute
        stress causes transient elevations in cortisol and mild alterations in mirror neuron activity,
        whereas chronic stress yields persistent physiological changes—elevated adrenal gland mass,
        higher baseline cortisol levels, and diminished mirror neuron activity that can remain even
        after the stressor is removed. Through phase-portrait and fixed-point analysis, we identify a
        key parameter D, which governs the dynamics of mirror neuron activity. When D is small,
        three fixed points arise, including two stable equilibria—one corresponding to a “healthy”
        (euthymic) state and the other associated with reduced mirror neuron activity (an “autistic”
        state). Under large D, the system supports only the euthymic fixed point, indicative of a non-
        susceptible population. Finally, we demonstrate that while acute reductions in stress have
        negligible impact on the long-term dynamics, chronic reduction of stress can restore cortisol
        levels and mirror neuron activity to the euthymic range. These findings suggest that chronic
        maternal stress can be a critical determinant in the onset of autism-like neurodevelopmen-
        tal trajectories for susceptible individuals and underscore the importance of sustained stress
        management interventions during pregnancy.
